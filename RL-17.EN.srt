2
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,910
You prepared this far.

3
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,910
thank you

4
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:38,910
Thank you for playing Baek Hyeon-woo, Yeongduri and Bae's youngest son, so well.

5
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:44,910
He wrote, “Thank you for giving birth to our first love, the wonderful Hyein.”

6
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,910
The king at the end of the eye applauds.

7
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,910
Thank you very much for your love.

8
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:59,910
The drama Queen of Tears, which filled home theaters with tears and laughter every weekend night, concluded its finale last week.

9
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,910
Are you sad to let us go?

10
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,910
So we prepared a special moment.

11
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,940
Hello, I'm Kim Jeong-ran, the actor who played the role of Hong Beom-ja in The Queen of Tears.

12
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,940
Are you ready to unwrap the special gifts prepared by the actors?

13
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,940
So shall we go?

14
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,940
Hello, I'm Kim Soo-hyun, who played Baek Hyun-woo in The Queen of Tears.

15
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:29,940
Hello, I'm Kim Ji-won, who played Hong Hye-in in The Queen of Tears.

16
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,940
La actriz Park Seong-eun interpreta a Yoon Eun-seom.

17
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,940
This is Park Dong-hyun, who plays Ong Soo-cheol. Nice to meet you.

18
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,940
This is Joo-bin Lee, who plays the role of Cheon-dal. Nice to meet you.

19
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,940
The drama Queen of Tears received a lot of attention due to the meeting of the queen of romantic comedy and the queen of romantic comedy.

20
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:49,940
It is said that there are many people who already predicted that the drama would be a hit even before it aired.

21
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,940
I feel very sad and sad.

22
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,940
I feel a little relieved

23
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:59,940
And above all, so many people love drama.

24
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,940
To the writer and director:

25
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,940
I feel so good that I can trust it this way.

26
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,940
Actually, I wasn't expecting it.

27
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,940
Still, I think I had high expectations.

28
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:21,940
I am truly grateful that you have given me so much more love than I expected.

29
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,940
Although many characters in this drama received great love,

30
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:31,300
It seems like Yoon Eun-seong received a lot of hate.

31
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,300
I'm upset, but I still did my part.

32
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,300
There is also a sense of identity.

33
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,300
I will do my best to create wonderful work.

34
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,300
Directed by writer Park Ji-eun, who has magical writing skills,

35
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,300
I hope everyone feels a little happier when it's over.

36
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,300
Director Jang Young-ho has meticulous directing skills.

37
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:54,300
We will do everything possible so that you do not regret having come.

38
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,300
And even director Kim Hee-won.

39
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,300
Following the Avengers reunion of the dramatic world, Legend of Legends

40
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,300
As the Miphobes combination is added,

41
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,300
It received attention as the most anticipated job in the first half of 2024.

42
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,300
And after the long-awaited first broadcast

43
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,300
Every episode gets a lot of love and the ratings also increase.

44
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:23,300
We also had a really amazing moment: the highest ratings of any tvN drama.

45
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,300
You know it's all thanks to you, right?

46
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:30,300
Can our actors simply stand still before the enthusiastic boasts of the spectators?

47
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,300
From the famous scene that immersed the actors too much,

48
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,300
The story behind the famous scene and

49
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,300
Even the queen of tears and the best lover chosen by the actors

50
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,300
You can see them all.

51
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,300
Now, let's take a look at the actors' favorite episodes?

52
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,300
My most memorable episode is

53
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,300
The epilogue part of episode 10.

54
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,300
As I pick up the leaves, I say, “I love you, Hyein.”

55
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,300
I love you

56
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,580
i love you hyein

57
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,580
That part was very memorable because I received a lot of praise.

58
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,580
ey

59
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,620
You are sitting?

60
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:28,270
I think it's part 7.

61
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:32,270
What kind of emotional bond do Hyein and Hyunwoo have?

62
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:35,270
The conflicts can be explained a little more.

63
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,270
It may be resolved

64
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,270
And then we move on to a new phase.

65
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,270
There were a lot of scenes with that kind of tension.

66
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,270
I wanted to do a little better while filming.

67
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,270
These were the scenes I focused on the most.

68
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,270
As those scenes continued,

69
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,270
I also forgot to monitor my performance now.

70
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:59,270
I became more immersed in the scene and became one of the spectators.

71
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,270
I think it was the episode where I started watching that drama.

72
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,270
I think episode 8 was really fun.

73
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,270
The content that ran from episode 1 to episode 7.

74
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,270
Spinning and spreading at once

75
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,270
I think it was kind of exciting because it was a time of transition.

76
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:17,270
We arrive at Yongduri at the end of Part 8.

77
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,270
The scene where I first met Yongduri's family.

78
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,270
Our drama now enters its second act.

79
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:29,100
I think it was the same scene from the beginning.

80
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,100
I think it's episode 16.

81
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:35,100
While collecting all the bait that had been placed earlier,

82
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,100
Good and evil are wonderfully achieved.

83
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:44,650
A love like that can exist.

84
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,650
In fact, in a way, Eunseong himself is

85
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,650
I thought it was a very pure love.

86
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,650
'Cause it's a love so twisted and twisted

87
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,650
You should never love like that.

88
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:59,650
I think it's a scene that gives you a feeling of well-being.

89
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:02,650
I would like to choose that scene.

90
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,650
As I was listening to the story, it was really one episode at a time.

91
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,650
It comes to mind, right?

92
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,650
Me too.

93
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:11,650
I'm a little embarrassed to say this out loud, but

94
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,650
Because every episode is legendary.

95
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,650
I'm sure it would be embarrassing to see it again.

96
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:20,650
This time, will we see each scene in more detail?

97
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,650
As the title is the title.

98
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,650
Let's start with the tearjerker scene that made the actors cry.

99
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,650
Hyunwoo and Hyein suffer a miscarriage.

100
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,650
When we had to endure the pain in our own rooms.

101
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,650
It was heartbreaking to watch him fall apart.

102
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,670
I would like to choose the ending of part 7.

103
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:57,670
When I found out that Hyunwoo was preparing for divorce,

104
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,670
I feel very betrayed

105
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:02,670
In a cold and blocked state.

106
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,670
When Hyunwoo approached

107
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:07,670
I lost all those recent memories.

108
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,780
I still don't have time

109
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,780
Time keeps flying

110
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:23,780
Hyunwoo is hugging me and it's so sad.

111
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,780
He cried very sadly.

112
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,780
I remember crying with him.

113
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,780
Don't come to the place where they are beating you.

114
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,780
A little like that?

115
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,780
In a state where Hyein is inserted

116
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,780
It's not because of Umbrella, it's because I hate Hyunwoo right now.

117
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,780
Hyunwoo just doesn't come.

118
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,780
For seeing Hyein cross her arms in an instant.

119
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,780
When Hyunwoo's emotions became too strong

120
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,780
It's like this...

121
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,700
Since the beginning of this drama.

122
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,700
The story about the family was very interesting.

123
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,700
I was looking forward to it

124
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,700
In part 11, my father

125
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,700
Come to Hyein who is sick.

126
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,700
Why didn't you tell your dad?

127
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,700
Are you OK? This is the scene you're talking about.

128
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,250
I cried a lot on set.

129
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,250
That's so sad

130
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,250
So that nagging feeling

131
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,250
I still have time to watch the broadcast.

132
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,250
I felt very sad when I saw the broadcast.

133
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,250
with that scene

134
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,250
The scene where my mother and sister talk in the hallway.

135
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,100
No...

136
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,100
The pain and the mistake I made

137
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,100
It doesn't matter

138
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,100
Since my mother couldn't recognize me so clearly,

139
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,060
I didn't want to say it

140
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:06,260
Instead of Hyunwoo and Aunt Beomja

141
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,260
Wouldn't I have cried a little less?

142
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,260
Hyein sheds a lot of tears at first.

143
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,260
I was not a person

144
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,260
Baek Hyun-woo, the Prince of Tears, always sheds tears.

145
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,260
Although I think about it, I really cried a lot.

146
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,260
Is there a scene you want to do?

147
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,260
part 14

148
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,260
In Germany where I come from

149
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,260
Hyunwoo and Hyein both

150
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,260
Just exploiting emotions

151
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,260
The scene is also memorable.

152
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,800
Film that part

153
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,800
Actually, it was very early.

154
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,800
In Korea, almost

155
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,800
While filming part 14

156
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,800
I went to Germany and suddenly

157
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,800
14 copies

158
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,800
I decided to take a photo in advance.

159
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,800
Both actors had a lot to worry about.

160
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,800
Even the director

161
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,800
you thought about it a lot

162
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,800
This is how the scene arose.

163
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,780
You can feel it in the place.

164
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,780
Adding that sense of reality

165
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,780
what I have

166
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,780
Try to stay focused as much as possible.

167
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,780
I think it feels like that

168
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,780
Soy

169
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,780
When Aunt Beomja cries, she cries like this.

170
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,780
aunt beomja

171
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,780
I told that to Mosuri

172
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,780
If you didn't do it harshly

173
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,780
Wouldn't my grandfather have been like that?

174
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,780
Things wouldn't have gotten so bad.

175
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,780
Just talking like that

176
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,780
There is a scene where I am crying.

177
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,780
That's why I felt depressed.

178
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,780
You could have done it this way

179
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,780
But I also saw it

180
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,780
For no reason I started crying.

181
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,780
Aunt

182
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,780
aunt beomja

183
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,780
in the car

184
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,780
Why did Miyoung die?

185
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,780
There is a scene like this.

186
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,780
that's really me

187
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,900
With my aunt at that time

188
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,900
that's how it is

189
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,900
Beomja cried as much as Hyein.

190
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,000
per liter

191
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Approximately 2 liters

192
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I think I cried

193
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Especially that wall scene.

194
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
in the video

195
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
mom told me

196
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Are your parents sick?

197
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
That scene when

198
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,930
My father is ill

199
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,930
I was at that time

200
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,930
It really makes me cry from the bottom of my heart.

201
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,930
The scene became so intense

202
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,930
Even now, I'm trying to cry

203
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,930
Anyway, the best part of that scene.

204
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,930
I honestly think I cried a lot.

205
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,930
what do you think about it?

206
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,930
To change the mood, this time

207
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:01,930
Shall we take a look at the laugh button scene?

208
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,930
It is?

209
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,930
maybe

210
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,930
Many people can say that

211
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,930
Soy

212
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,930
I'm finally revealing it to all of you.

213
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,930
My heart is really racing.

214
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,930
scene mansungi

215
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,930
Mansungi

216
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,280
In fact, even during filming

217
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,280
From Hyein's perspective,

218
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,280
My younger brother is Hong Soo-cheol.

219
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,280
he's doing that again

220
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,280
Looking a little pathetic

221
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,280
that's what I have to do

222
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,280
It was very difficult to contain my laughter.

223
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,280
it's a scene

224
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,280
I want to become king more

225
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,280
Wireless microphone

226
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,280
Just because I wanted to kick him

227
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,280
I kicked him on purpose

228
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,280
looking for something better

229
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,280
I think I made it

230
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,280
Correct

231
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,280
Do you remember this time at the filming location?

232
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,280
There was an unexpected fun challenge.

233
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,280
Of course the actors

234
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,280
Even the production team had to contain their laughter.

235
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,280
I worked hard

236
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,280
Well, thanks anyway, I can't forget it.

237
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,280
A famous scene was born.

238
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,280
You do a lot of improvisation and you're good at it.

239
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,280
Are you leaving the scene?

240
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,280
Or do you think about it beforehand while reading the script?

241
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,280
Actually we

242
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,280
In this scene

243
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,280
No improvised tanto.

244
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,280
most

245
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,280
What I focused on

246
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,280
Chinese is taught in Part 11.

247
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,280
This person is from China.

248
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,280
Even though you understand Korean,

249
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,280
you can not speak

250
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,280
Any Chinese words in the script.

251
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,280
He told himself he would do it.

252
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,280
It's too onerous.

253
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,280
So with the directors

254
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,280
We had many meetings.

255
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,280
Is he really just any Chinese or a fake Chinese?

256
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,280
After thinking about it, it is the emperor's pack.

257
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,280
That's really true

258
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,280
Actor Kim Ji-won told us.

259
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,280
he knows chinese

260
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,280
How about something like this?

261
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,280
It's very funny. It is the emperor's pack.

262
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,280
Thanks for recommending Chinese dramas too.

263
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,280
The Kinji Department smile button is

264
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,280
You would know without me saying it, right?

265
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,280
Thanks to our Sucheol

266
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,280
I laughed a lot throughout the entire shoot.

267
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,280
But you know what?

268
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,280
Soocheol's comic style

269
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,280
Our family of queens

270
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,280
Baja al campo de Yongdu-ri.

271
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,280
As I progressed

272
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,280
It was time to spend the first night in Yongduri.

273
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,280
Between my father-in-law's lines:

274
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,280
There was a line like this

275
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,280
I was so careless

276
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,280
I remember exploding

277
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,280
Hye-in-mo, good and evil

278
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,280
¿ Exiliado en Yongduri?

279
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,280
I had to take refuge

280
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,790
I drink a cup of coffee

281
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,790
For veteran foreign workers

282
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,790
I was also hit

283
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,660
Eat excessively

284
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,460
You need to take sleeping pills and sleep for a long time.

285
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,460
Just stretch it like this

286
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:38,340
make that scene

287
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,340
fun and impressive

288
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,340
I think I saw it

289
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,340
At the same time as the Yongduri emergency landing,

290
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,340
As the unexpected allure of the Queens family is revealed,

291
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,340
It gave me an unexpected laugh.

292
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,340
But in the other hand

293
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,340
There was something that made me angry until the end.

294
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,020
That's me

295
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,020
At the end of Part 15

296
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,370
I also have a voice role.

297
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,370
I'm rooting for Hyunwoo and Hyein.

298
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,370
everyone now

299
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,370
People all over the country are applauding.

300
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,370
At the moment when the two are about to meet

301
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,370
Defeating Hyunwoo

302
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:17,830
I was screaming while reading the script.

303
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,830
How can humans do this?

304
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,830
How did the author come up with this idea?

305
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,830
You can imagine?

306
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,830
I admire him too

307
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,830
He is a very toxic person.

308
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,830
I'm really angry

309
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,830
Eunseong-ah

310
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,830
Eunseong

311
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,830
When you try to kill a dog.

312
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,440
What's wrong with that person?

313
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,440
Even for a dog that's nothing.

314
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,440
I feel that way

315
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,440
With power and money

316
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,440
I wondered if he was trying to control me.

317
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,440
You are so bad?

318
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,440
With Mosul

319
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,440
Eunseong Yoon

320
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,440
To drive out Queens Autumn

321
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,440
Those driving scenes

322
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,440
Eunseong Yoon

323
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,440
Hide cameras here and there

324
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,440
Those scenes that I was seeing

325
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,440
that is

326
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,440
me the most

327
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,440
I think it was a scene that made me feel soft.

328
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,440
Although it was only for a short time, how did it feel to become president of Queens Group?

329
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,620
In fact

330
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,620
I felt like I had it all

331
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,620
I am just

332
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,620
President

333
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,620
President Hong Mandu, please sit in your seat.

334
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,620
looking like this

335
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,620
There was a scene like that

336
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,620
Do you feel like a king?

337
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,620
And now there's only one left

338
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,620
All I need is a lover

339
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,620
In a previous interview with actor Sung Hoon,

340
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,620
Did you know you said you preferred to play bad guys?

341
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,620
Would you consider playing the good guy in your next project?

342
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,620
Yes I'm a bad boy too

343
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,620
Get angry and waste energy.

344
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,620
There are some parts that are not easy.

345
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,620
good season

346
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,620
I want to do it

347
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,620
And isn't it time to do it again?

348
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,620
Next time I will definitely greet you kindly.

349
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,620
Now, let's change the question slightly.

350
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,620
Besides your own character, who is your favorite character?

351
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,620
I am very curious

352
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,620
aunt beomja

353
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,120
Of course, the Sanskrit characters

354
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,340
Me gusta mucho Beomja Sunbaenim.

355
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,340
Isn't he so attractive?

356
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,340
Well, it is full of charm.

357
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,340
I think the character with the most human side is Beomja.

358
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,340
And it's very unstoppable

359
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,340
He is a cider character.

360
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,340
It's refreshing when Sanskrit characters appear.

361
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,340
The atmosphere is always fresh.

362
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,340
I was there when they were filming the memorial service scene.

363
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,340
She was sitting there like my daughter-in-law.

364
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,340
because it was so much fun

365
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,340
So much so that my face turns very red.

366
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,340
after waiting for it

367
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,340
When I feel like the camera is taking a photo of me at any moment

368
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,340
He had a serious expression and then again.

369
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,340
It's like this

370
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,340
I can't sleep because of this scene

371
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,340
I was really under a lot of pressure.

372
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,340
Because it's a fun scene.

373
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,340
I was excited, but at the same time

374
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,340
A certain fear of having to do it well.

375
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,340
Because of these complex emotions

376
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,340
Although it was very difficult

377
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,340
Still, it went well and he had fun.

378
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,340
I feel so lucky

379
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,340
If you see Aunt Beomja taking pictures,

380
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,340
vicarious catharsis

381
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,340
from the side

382
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,340
Observing the scene in which you are acting.

383
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,340
I can't help but laugh too.

384
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,340
I remember being excited

385
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,340
old people

386
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,340
I'm actually by your side

387
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,340
While watching

388
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,340
I'm afraid you might feel overwhelmed.

389
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,340
I couldn't tell you

390
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,340
Always with a great fan spirit.

391
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,340
I went to the scene

392
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,340
for being my aunt

393
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,340
Thank you so much

394
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,340
It was so reassuring.

395
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,340
thank you

396
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,340
Oh I'm crying

397
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,760
Wow

398
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,760
The kind and pretty Jiwon in our world.

399
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,760
In the future too

400
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,760
In more diverse works

401
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,760
Challenging various characters.

402
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,760
As a senior, I will support you to become a great actor.

403
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,750
I love you

404
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,750
Now, this time, showing off the best chemistry.

405
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,750
Behind the scenes stories of couples.

406
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,750
It's your turn to listen.

407
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,750
First, I generated enthusiasm and then

408
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,750
I made it float

409
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,750
Romantic protagonists of the world.

410
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,750
Let's start with the story of the Baekkong couple.

411
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,750
In front of Yongduri supermarket

412
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,750
Hyunwoo and Hyein

413
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,750
I will continue to be by your side

414
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,750
There was a scene where they were talking.

415
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,680
When filming that day.

416
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,680
The day was so nice

417
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,680
First of all, I feel very happy.

418
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,680
This is also the scene we filmed.

419
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,680
That line Hyunwoo said

420
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,680
For me too

421
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,680
I think there was a great impact.

422
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:01,860
Who came first, Hyunwoo or Hyein?

423
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,860
Please decide if you like it or not.

424
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,860
This is Hong Hye-in.

425
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,860
Kicking that copier

426
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,860
I'm secretly waiting for Hyunwoo.

427
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,860
I think I called you

428
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,860
With the sound of the photocopier kicking

429
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,270
first time in high school

430
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,270
The day I moved to school.

431
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:34,270
I met you on the playground

432
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,270
Because it was actually Hyunwoo who did something good back then.

433
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,270
Hyein probably first

434
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,270
Wouldn't I like it?

435
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,270
Give me a band?

436
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,270
The man who gave me the band.

437
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,270
first? with that feeling

438
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,270
100 points

439
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,270
200 points

440
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,270
Perfect score

441
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,270
very loving queen

442
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,270
Actriz Kim Soo Yeon

443
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,270
prepared improvisations

444
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,270
Those things make me a little more

445
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,270
Near Hong Hye-in

446
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,270
I even did it

447
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,270
so perfect for me

448
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,270
was a partner

449
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:10,270
Hyun-woo takes a hit and Hye-in arrives.

450
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,270
Now if something like that happens, I run away.

451
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:14,270
When I said that, I stuck my little finger in.

452
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,270
We bet, this too

453
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,270
It was Hyunwoo's idea.

454
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,270
That Hye-in is in Yongduri

455
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,270
Go and stab Sucheol in the back.

456
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,270
while hitting

457
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,270
Drink a main dish

458
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,270
When Hyunwoo

459
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,270
Not for me

460
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,270
The something

461
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,270
Not for me

462
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:36,270
a little bit of these things

463
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,270
As more accumulate

464
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,270
More diverse characters

465
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,270
I think it was done in several ways.

466
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,270
Not for me

467
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,270
Tell us the story behind creating improv.

468
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,270
Our sister Miseon

469
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:50,270
Ugh, while he's doing it

470
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,270
Making a concerned gesture

471
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:54,270
Don't worry about your sister

472
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:56,270
to press it

473
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,200
something in the field

474
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,200
true to atmosphere

475
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,230
Wasn't it a feeling?

476
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,230
in Germany

477
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:15,230
Hyein abandons treatment

478
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,230
Hyunwoo somehow

479
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,230
So Hyein can live

480
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,230
I will try it

481
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,230
and hold on to it

482
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,230
You knew everything anyway

483
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,230
I'm just doing this

484
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,420
Even when we really film

485
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,420
See

486
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,420
Although I know this is a lie

487
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,420
it was so bad

488
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,420
He was harsh and cold towards Hyunwoo.

489
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,420
I treated it like that, but actually, while acting,

490
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,420
Have you ever received a horse award?

491
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,420
Not you too

492
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,420
As you probably know

493
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,420
Hyein's body

494
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,420
That is not true.

495
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,420
So I don't think there was anything hurtful at all.

496
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,350
When Hye-in was kicked out of the company,

497
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,350
because they save me

498
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,350
With security guards in the office.

499
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,350
Come out so quickly together

500
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,350
And try to get it out

501
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,350
I did it, but Hyein did it.

502
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,350
He told me to get off work and interrupted him.

503
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,350
At that time, I was on the scene.

504
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:30,350
I feel so relieved

505
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,350
Because it was like that.

506
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:34,350
When Youngsook was

507
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,350
company

508
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,350
in that resting space

509
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,350
Hyein says raccoons live there

510
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,350
I'm lying

511
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,350
I saw it?

512
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,350
How could it be like this?

513
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,350
pure and

514
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,350
naively

515
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,350
Did you act like you were fooled by Hyein?

516
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:14,610
What did you think of Baek Hyun-woo's cuteness?

517
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,610
I was just born that way

518
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:24,610
This is

519
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,610
Actually, there's something that wasn't in the script.

520
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:28,610
I didn't expect it at all

521
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,610
I checked it later

522
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,610
You said your lines so cutely

523
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,610
I'm proud

524
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:36,610
I really enjoyed it

525
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:38,610
I have a memory

526
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,610
I was just born that way

527
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:42,610
That I have to do?

528
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,640
I knew it would be like this

529
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,640
I checked the angle to do this.

530
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,640
In tribute to Jivon Kim

531
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,860
On the other hand, the couple Hyunwoo and Hyein

532
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,860
There are those who are ultimately frustrated by rigidity.

533
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,860
as soon as

534
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,860
A fool who only knows Hyein.

535
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,470
This is Eunseong.

536
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,470
I think that's all.

537
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,470
From childhood through life

538
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:09,470
You have been in love with someone else.

539
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,470
In that sense

540
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,470
very consistent

541
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,700
I loved it

542
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,560
That's how it is

543
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,560
Because Hyunwoo is in the middle.

544
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,560
I didn't even think about getting divorced.

545
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,560
But Eunseong is having none of that.

546
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,560
All my life

547
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,560
Because he lived only looking at Hyein.

548
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,560
I think it can be defined as a sunflower-like character.

549
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,560
What is the actor's favorite epilogue?

550
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,660
I'm at 15

551
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,660
Hyein was by my side for a month.

552
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,660
trapped together

553
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,660
At that time, it was a truly earthly love.

554
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,660
With a very pure heart.

555
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,660
The way he takes care of Hyein

556
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,660
So Eunseong

557
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,660
I can't hate you

558
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,660
Isn't it a moment?

559
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,660
A Hyein

560
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,660
Because the only real Hyunwoo was there.

561
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,660
The person named Yoon Eun-seong is

562
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,660
college friends

563
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,660
Or when we meet now that we are older

564
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,660
business partner

565
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,660
I think it's always been that way.

566
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,660
I feel like I've always crossed a line

567
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,660
A person named Eunseong Yoon

568
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:18,690
Because you keep crossing the line

569
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,100
Episode 14: After surgery

570
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,100
Hyein wakes up and appears in front of her.

571
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,100
Eunseong

572
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,100
Eunseong is looking out the window.

573
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,100
Hye-in feels popular.

574
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,100
Just turning around

575
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,220
smiling

576
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,220
so kind to the world

577
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,220
It gives a little scary

578
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,220
people who seem nice

579
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,220
I thought it must be scary.

580
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,220
Did you feel a little bit of a sense of crisis?

581
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,960
Is that possible?

582
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,960
If it weren't for that choice

583
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,960
Eunseong is very confident in his abilities.

584
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,960
beautifully

585
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,960
I think he was a person who could live well.

586
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,960
Isn't this a twisted love?

587
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,960
If he

588
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,960
Si Eunseong is reborn

589
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,960
Even things like nursery furniture

590
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,960
Because it's not something I can choose.

591
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,960
Return to Korea as soon as possible.

592
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,960
I go to Seoul National University.

593
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,960
So I joined the Finns.

594
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,960
So instead of defending

595
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,960
Let's get to know Hyein a little first.

596
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,960
love so normal

597
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,820
Continuous

598
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,820
Eunseong is more attractive than his brother.

599
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,750
It's the same thing I said before.

600
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,750
Good driving force

601
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,750
At least for Hyein

602
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,750
always always sweet

603
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,750
What is better is

604
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,750
Am I a little taller?

605
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,750
a bit?

606
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:42,000
Something like this

607
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
So clever

608
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,540
Department stores have to pay a fine

609
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,540
and the drama

610
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,540
I felt it as I looked at it.

611
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,540
seems a bit silly

612
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,540
some part is missing

613
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,700
pretended to do it

614
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,700
I have a bit of a crafty side.

615
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,700
I did not do anything

616
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,630
Already trapped

617
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:09,730
Mira esto, Baek Hyun-woo.

618
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:11,730
if I'm looking

619
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,730
So he wasn't really attractive?

620
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:16,210
next

621
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:18,210
They are a couple that made as many people cry as other male comedy couples.

622
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:20,210
The bastion of the circuit conveyed emotion.

623
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:22,210
red floor couple

624
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:24,210
Let's listen to the story of Su-cheol and Da-hye.

625
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:28,820
100 points?

626
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,820
I would like to give it about 75 points.

627
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,820
It was very good

628
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,820
How do you know if you saw the broadcast,

629
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,820
You were out a lot in the middle or last part.

630
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,820
Then I was very sad.

631
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,820
They give a lot of energy on set.

632
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,820
I found it difficult

633
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,820
Even the parts I didn't trust

634
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,820
Featuring Soocheol

635
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,820
I had the sensation of being dragged with me.

636
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,820
Thank you so much

637
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,820
75% of the future

638
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,820
further

639
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,820
Our couple is different in this sense.

640
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,820
A behind-the-scenes photo shoot you'll want to show off

641
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,820
Please give me a funny episode

642
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,820
Us

643
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,820
Because they are a couple with a child.

644
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,820
In fact, even in the field

645
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,820
Checking Gunwoo's condition

646
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,820
Because of this

647
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,820
I think I was confident

648
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,870
You do not like anything?

649
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,870
my hands like this

650
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:25,870
You are a teacher

651
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,870
The greatest power in our field.

652
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:29,870
absolute power

653
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,870
When shooting

654
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,870
Geonwoo is a mother and father.

655
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,870
Who did you like the most?

656
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,870
I can say this with confidence

657
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,870
I liked my mom more

658
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:41,870
So I was a little upset.

659
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,870
They look so alike you could believe they were family.

660
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,870
Does Joobi also think the same?

661
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,870
in fact

662
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,870
When I saw Geonwoo's photo

663
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,870
No, it's all the same

664
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,870
How is this

665
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,870
While narrating in the letter,

666
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,870
Geonwoo has a head injury.

667
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,870
Geonwoo is not your son.

668
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,870
You can't tell just by looking at it.

669
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:03,870
You are an Arab merchant, but Geonwoo is a tofu merchant.

670
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,870
this makes sense

671
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,870
Wow, this could be controversial.

672
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:09,870
I thought so

673
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,870
I feel like Geonwoo is also an Arab merchant.

674
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:25,870
It is also famous as a romantic restaurant.

675
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,870
queen of tears

676
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,870
This is because there are lovers who cannot distinguish between superiority and inferiority.

677
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,870
our actors

678
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:33,870
Who exactly?

679
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,870
Was he chosen as the best lover?

680
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:44,850
Un amante tan grande como Baek Hyun-woo

681
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,850
So what

682
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,850
A few seconds?

683
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,850
Pero Baek Hyun-woo

684
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:56,850
I think I'm an aunt

685
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,850
I'm the couple Beomjayoungsun.

686
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,850
I love him so much

687
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,850
Even when looking at the script

688
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:04,850
that

689
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,850
Another love for Aunt Beomja

690
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:08,940
Oh my Hong Beomja, are you crazy?

691
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,940
Even when looking at the script

692
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,940
I was very excited

693
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,940
The chemistry between the two elders.

694
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,940
You are so, so cute

695
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,170
It is real?

696
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:25,330
Con Youngsoon

697
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:27,330
Even in chemistry

698
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:29,330
although you are a very loving person

699
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:31,330
Thinking about family

700
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:33,330
huge

701
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:35,550
bear lover

702
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,550
They say that only Baek Seobang knows that Hye-in is sick.

703
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:41,700
But why are you alone?

704
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,700
They say you only need to know about the last night of chronic illness.

705
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,700
Why did you send it alone?

706
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,700
Why did you send the child alone?

707
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,700
Soy

708
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,700
With Aunt Beomja

709
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,700
Warmth when shooting

710
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,700
I was very sorry

711
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,700
Because she was a wonderful aunt.

712
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,700
I'm Aunt Beomja.

713
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,700
I think he could be the best lover.

714
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,700
It seems inevitable that there will be conflicting opinions.

715
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,700
I think it's iron water

716
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,700
¿Soocheol?

717
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,700
Searchol it

718
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,700
In fact

719
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,700
I feel like a friend who has the purest love.

720
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,700
Extraño a Kwon Woo took Kwon Woo.

721
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,700
A scene where I try to tell you something.

722
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,700
And because it didn't work the way I wanted

723
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,700
Scenes that make me cry because I miss you

724
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,700
It was funny though

725
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,700
at the same time it is very sad

726
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,700
Oh that friend

727
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,700
You are truly in love with pure love.

728
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,700
I think he is a character like Ondal, a fool.

729
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,700
pure and innocent

730
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,700
Due to these aspects

731
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,700
They say they gave me the nickname stupid.

732
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,700
I think Soocheol was similar.

733
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,700
It's not Dahye's original appearance.

734
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,700
Although I treated Sucheol with a made-up appearance,

735
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,700
Because clearly there was real heart in it.

736
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,700
In the times that came and went

737
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,700
Searchol it

738
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,700
What kind of person is this person?

739
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,700
What kind of person was he in the past?

740
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,700
this doesn't matter anymore

741
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,700
Now I love you

742
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,700
because there

743
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,700
Why did you come here

744
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,700
I have to live with you

745
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,700
I will never send you and my son anywhere.

746
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,700
Dahyeun

747
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,700
With so much love and support

748
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,700
I never received attention

749
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,700
Something to receive from your parents

750
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,700
A friend who has never received love.

751
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,700
I don't even know how to give love

752
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,700
I didn't even know I would receive it.

753
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,700
I've never told anyone in my life.

754
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,700
I have never been treated like this

755
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,700
That's what you did to me

756
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:31,330
I keep remembering

757
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,330
Even that part

758
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:35,330
Searchol

759
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:37,330
Because I showed you everything and gave you my heart first.

760
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:47,330
At that time I was like Soocheol.

761
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:49,330
If you love someone like that

762
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:51,330
Trust me like this

763
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:53,330
I feel like I have to protect him until the end.

764
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:55,330
I think I could have it

765
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:57,330
So I think this is true love.

766
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:59,330
What is the most heartbreaking moment for your character?

767
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:01,330
When is

768
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:03,330
in part 15

769
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:05,330
When I went to save Dahye

770
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,330
The scene itself is now

771
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:09,330
Su-cheol is completely proactive.

772
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:11,330
do something with your own power

773
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:13,330
Solve the problem and protect your loved ones.

774
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:15,330
Because it was that kind of scene.

775
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:17,330
that was a bit

776
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:23,330
Soo-cheol won the title of Queen of Tears and Best Lover.

777
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:25,330
Congratulations

778
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,330
When you hear the story

779
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,330
Am I the only one who gets more curious the more I listen?

780
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:31,330
Of course you too, right?

781
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:33,330
So I got ready

782
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,330
Full of TMI from actors.

783
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,330
Viewers ask anything

784
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:39,330
Extra time edition

785
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,330
Actor Kim Jae-won

786
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:43,330
You said you would eat Sichuan Jjajang Ramen after the schedule ended.

787
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:45,330
I wonder if you ate it

788
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,330
Ate

789
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,330
Fear of being hit

790
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:51,330
For the spectators

791
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:53,330
Please call me baby shark

792
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:55,330
true true true

793
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:57,330
Toorututuru in the sea

794
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:59,330
baby shark

795
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:01,330
baby shark tururu turu

796
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:03,330
beautiful tooruturu

797
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:05,330
Toorututuru in the sea

798
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:07,330
baby shark

799
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:09,330
I'm really proud of myself for memorizing the lyrics.

800
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:11,330
Actor Kim Soo Hyun

801
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:13,330
Among the places I went while filming in Germany

802
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:15,330
Please tell us your most memorable place.

803
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:17,330
I also remember the lavender fields.

804
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:25,520
on my day off

805
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,520
actually once

806
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,520
I also went to the zoo

807
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,520
everything was good

808
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,520
Please visit Germany

809
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,520
suggestion

810
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,520
Which wedding photo do you like the most?

811
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,520
along with the veil

812
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,520
Covered and filmed

813
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,520
I like that picture

814
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,520
soy hyunwoo

815
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,520
santal scene

816
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,520
that slightly wet

817
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,520
head and

818
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,520
muscles and

819
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,520
wrapped in a robe

820
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,520
those three things

821
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,520
As we come together

822
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,520
while admiring

823
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,520
Although it was a man, I looked at him with excitement.

824
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,550
because?

825
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,550
Baek Hyunwoo is so cute when he's drunk.

826
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,550
They say no because you look so cute when you're drunk.

827
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,550
If actor Kim Soo-hyun is really drunk,

828
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,550
You're so cute? I'm very, very, very curious.

829
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,550
when I'm drunk

830
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:17,580
I sleep well

831
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,580
Filming ended in Germany.

832
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,580
I had a company dinner the day before I left.

833
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:24,000
I even slept in the water.

834
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
What is your favorite blog?

835
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
My favorite blog is

836
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Hyunwoo

837
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Hye-in's life jacket was secretly used while she was sleeping.

838
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
This is the epilogue I drew.

839
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
It's kind of nice too

840
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
A little sad

841
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I think it was that type of application.

842
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Is there any OST that has impressed you the most? I'm also curious why

843
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Called by Crush

844
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I'm sorry, thank you, I love you.

845
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I'm sorry, I love you, thank you.

846
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Sorry, I hate you, thank you.

847
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,030
I love you I am sorry

848
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:54,030
I'm sorry Crush I'm sorry

849
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:58,030
It's true that I like it

850
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:00,030
I'm sorry, I hate you, I love you

851
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:02,030
I'm sorry, I love you, I love you

852
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:04,030
Sorry, thanks, Crush.

853
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,120
I'm sorry, I hate you, I love you

854
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,120
I'm sorry for the crush

855
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,120
I wonder who the NG king was in the scene.

856
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,120
Hyunwoo Hyunwoo

857
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,120
I think it was me. I think it was me.

858
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,280
Is Hyunwoo really the king of NG?

859
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,280
Shall we check it for ourselves?

860
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,280
It can only be seen on special broadcasts.

861
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,280
NG Queen of Tears Parade

862
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,280
See you right now.

863
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:40,060
Because because because because

864
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:53,090
I'm sorry

865
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,090
The boss wants you to come.

866
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:57,820
Didn't you see that I'm in a meeting right now?

867
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:02,430
I came here because I was in a hurry.

868
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,430
Just 10 minutes

869
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:06,430
ah

870
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:08,980
Yeah

871
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,260
Let's eat together

872
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,260
We were going to go to Hotel J and eat that, right?

873
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,260
I'm sorry

874
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,260
My mother-in-law said she had already filed the complaint.

875
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,260
we will receive it

876
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,260
This is the camera again.

877
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,260
I'm sorry

878
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,260
My mother-in-law said she had already filed the complaint.

879
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,260
Us

880
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:37,120
Take it and see

881
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,870
Who said that?

882
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:47,870
Do what is comfortable for you.

883
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:50,930
whatever you want

884
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:52,930
while I go

885
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:58,990
as you wish

886
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:01,340
They said they wanted to see the first snow early.

887
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:03,340
It's everything you wanted

888
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:08,770
I'm sorry

889
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:11,310
If it turns out that you are sick

890
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:13,310
Because I don't want your family to take it away from me.

891
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:16,240
It's okay to be worried

892
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,240
I'm afraid your family will take it away from me.

893
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,910
I'm worried

894
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,910
Well

895
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:25,200
Because I don't want your family to take it away from me.

896
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,200
I know you are worried

897
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,060
however

898
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:33,250
Nothing that I held in my hand

899
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,250
because I don't want to miss it

900
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:37,600
that?

901
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,600
maestro

902
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,600
I caught it

903
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,600
Hello Hyunwoo

904
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,760
Puja

905
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,370
I don't listen to you even if you talk dirty

906
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:50,370
Burned

907
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:52,370
everything is burned

908
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:54,370
Since I started talking with seasoning

909
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:56,370
everything is burned

910
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:58,370
The original is delicious.

911
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:00,370
Eat the burnt food and then my sister.

912
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:02,370
eat

913
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:14,660
be careful

914
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,660
Your brothers

915
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,660
little last month

916
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:24,660
I'm sorry

917
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,660
Baeksapang

918
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,660
My special team is revenge.

919
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,660
I already know very well

920
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,660
thank you

921
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:34,660
Well

922
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,660
Check the risks first

923
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:40,930
The review is

924
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:42,930
Nothing bad happened

925
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:45,090
Suchan-ah

926
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:53,680
I need to review it

927
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,120
with my heart

928
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,860
Please save me

929
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,860
Director Baek

930
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:21,200
Don't worry

931
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:28,540
Are you living well?

932
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:30,540
If living together seems like it would kill you, just do it.

933
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,540
it's better than dying

934
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:35,860
Sister, this is

935
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:37,860
The noodles were good.

936
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:39,860
Add more sesame oil

937
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,860
I'm fine

938
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:44,590
I need to add more to use it.

939
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:46,590
Hey, bring this

940
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:48,590
I feel money

941
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:51,140
does not exist

942
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:53,140
Because I feed children well

943
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:55,140
Hyun-woo

944
00:43:55,140 --> 00:44:00,340
hold a spoon

945
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:05,380
I said I was home

946
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,380
Now my mom and dad have half their faces.

947
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:09,380
If you take a deep breath and sit down

948
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:14,240
This house will also become a cushion of thorns.

949
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,240
there are thorns

950
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:27,360
baby

951
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,360
Although I have everything

952
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,860
Bastard

953
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:38,020
What does it mean to do it well?

954
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:40,020
When I see what you see in your eyes, there is no place to feel it.

955
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:53,420
Oh my

956
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:55,420
Have you ever met a bastard like that?

957
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,580
wake up boy

958
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:06,340
come to work

959
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,340
I'm sorry

960
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:10,340
It was not a unilateral blow.

961
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:14,220
Oh try

962
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:23,780
Where are you now

963
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:28,940
You're going?

964
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,940
When I was dating Hyein

965
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:32,940
There is also ice cream

966
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,940
There is also a normal table.

967
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,940
It's in Mungyeong.

968
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:38,940
There is no neighborhood like Odu-ri.

969
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:41,100
It is

970
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:44,610
I also ate rice

971
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:46,610
If you go with Dugwan hyung,

972
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,610
Con Yonghye Noona

973
00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:50,700
all

974
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,700
Why don't you cut it?

975
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:58,640
I am very curious

976
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,940
careful

977
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:04,940
well leveled

978
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:10,990
ah

979
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:23,200
still

980
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,200
Grandpa's birthday this year.

981
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,200
Because you asked me to take it silently

982
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,200
I'm really naive, what can I do?

983
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,200
Don't fool your grandfather.

984
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,200
all

985
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,200
it's a test

986
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,200
Boss, get rid of him.

987
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,870
is not an answer

988
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:41,870
It's a no answer

989
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:48,260
What happen?

990
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:50,260
Yeah

991
00:46:53,120 --> 00:47:12,850
So

992
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:14,850
I received my son from there.

993
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:16,850
Yeah

994
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:18,850
If time passes my mind gets exhausted

995
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:29,710
I'm sorry

996
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:31,710
ID and corporate card of that day.

997
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:33,710
Technological equipment and laptop.

998
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:35,710
With that nail clipper grenade

999
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:37,710
Don't get hurt anywhere

1000
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:39,710
So there's nothing to do

1001
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:43,120
Hontalk

1002
00:47:43,120 --> 00:48:07,580
action

1003
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:09,580
our secretary

1004
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:11,580
our politic

1005
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:13,620
construction

1006
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:15,620
He says can you see it?

1007
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:17,620
ah

1008
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:19,710
That's how it is

1009
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:21,710
Hwangjang

1010
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:28,450
you that car

1011
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:32,910
you are that car

1012
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,780
How do you know

1013
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:37,810
ah

1014
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:39,810
What happens if I stick it on the bottom shelf?

1015
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:41,810
Paste it here

1016
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:43,810
No, you have to stick it on the ground.

1017
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:45,810
The continuation is configured.

1018
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:47,900
Yeah

1019
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:50,700
get along

1020
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,700
I don't think you're acting

1021
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,700
This is how I feel

1022
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:58,140
as much as you can

1023
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:00,140
I want to treat you well

1024
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:05,250
Just once for us

1025
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:07,250
Let's go again

1026
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:09,280
practice

1027
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,280
I'm so out of it

1028
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,280
I was just driving

1029
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,280
I just went home and saw my grandfather.

1030
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:21,070
let's live together someday

1031
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:36,720
GOOD

1032
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,720
this is my neighborhood

1033
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,720
it's a neighborhood

1034
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:53,410
I'm sorry

1035
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:55,410
Can I have some Beecher, please?

1036
00:49:55,410 --> 00:50:00,320
Can I ask you a favor?

1037
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,800
I'm in big trouble

1038
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,900
If it turns out that you are sick

1039
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,900
I'm afraid your family will take it away from me.

1040
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:36,820
sister

1041
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:38,820
what are you doing

1042
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:40,820
I'm sorry

1043
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:54,640
Don't worry

1044
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,640
Something like that

1045
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:08,530
Hyein is still by my side

1046
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:10,530
if you look at it

1047
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:41,230
I'm sorry

1048
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:43,230
I made a mistake

1049
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,980
This time the spectators

1050
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,980
They say they prepared a surprise gift for the actors.

1051
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:06,980
Let's make a try

1052
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:08,980
Kim Soo-hyun, I am one of them.

1053
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:10,980
Aren't you the same age as me?

1054
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:12,980
No

1055
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:14,980
I ate a lot

1056
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:16,980
I wish my sister

1057
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:18,980
Every time I look in the mirror I see Kim Ji-won.

1058
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:20,980
because I can see it

1059
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:25,710
How about you marry me instead of Hyein?

1060
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:27,710
The seat next to me is empty.

1061
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:29,710
who are you

1062
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:32,320
First you need to know who you are.

1063
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,320
Please contact me personally

1064
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,320
Let me try to feel it.

1065
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:40,990
Eat eat eat.

1066
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:42,990
you are already a legend

1067
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:48,820
It is very difficult to react

1068
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:50,820
Combining consonants and vowels

1069
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:52,820
You can form several words.

1070
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:54,820
but I'm a fool

1071
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:56,820
I only know 3 letters

1072
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:58,820
I love you

1073
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:00,820
when my brother is surprised

1074
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:02,820
I can't say oh my god

1075
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:04,820
oh my me

1076
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:07,820
thank you

1077
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:10,170
Jiwon unni has a warm tone.

1078
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:12,170
Is it a cold tone or

1079
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:14,170
I will never be able to complete it in my life.

1080
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:16,170
It's a love marathon

1081
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:18,520
This is a love marathon to complete.

1082
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,520
bark

1083
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,520
Handsome is hard to spell

1084
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,520
I memorized him as Park Seong-hoon.

1085
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,520
thank you

1086
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,520
Thank you very much for remembering my real name.

1087
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,520
Baekhyun, you are a touch player.

1088
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,520
I want you to keep hitting my heart

1089
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,520
it must be a mistake too

1090
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,520
I think there is a strong misunderstanding.

1091
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,520
I went to the Han River

1092
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,520
I do not see it

1093
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,520
I see Kwak Dong-yeon

1094
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,520
I think you saw it wrong

1095
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,520
What are the constellations?

1096
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,520
I sit next to my sister

1097
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,520
Unless you're going to marry me

1098
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,520
Stop flirting.

1099
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,520
I think there is a slight misunderstanding.

1100
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,520
Kim Ji-won is a water bearer.

1101
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,520
Tag book

1102
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,520
A blessing that will never happen again in my life.

1103
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,520
It is a happiness that makes you smile just by looking at it.

1104
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:06,150
Everyone says Park Seong-hoon is Park Seong-hoon.

1105
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:08,150
I saw how handsome you were

1106
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:10,150
Parque Seong-hoon Parque Seong-hoon

1107
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:12,150
This is also called Seong-hoon Park.

1108
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:14,150
Thank you so much

1109
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:16,150
My name is Park Seonghoon.

1110
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:18,150
Parque Seonghoon

1111
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:22,180
Parque Seong-hoon Parque Seong-hoon

1112
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:26,280
It hits my heart every time I see it.

1113
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,280
knocking it down

1114
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,280
The sexy dynamite boxing king, Kim Soo-man

1115
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,280
No

1116
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:34,280
When you say king of boxing

1117
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,280
many boxers

1118
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,280
because there are too many

1119
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,280
sexy dynamite

1120
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,280
thank you

1121
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,280
I'll do my best

1122
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,280
Our Sucheol

1123
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,280
I know what I caught during Doljabi.

1124
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,280
My heart

1125
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,280
Please contact me later and I will return it to you.

1126
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,280
Sister, I suddenly had a good idea.

1127
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,280
thinking about my sister

1128
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,280
Ah, I like my idea.

1129
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,280
Oh!, how beautiful

1130
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:01,580
Who likes it?

1131
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:04,990
Hi, I'm Nu.

1132
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:06,990
Oh, does this one suit your tastes a little?

1133
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,200
Your voice is so refreshing

1134
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:15,530
I got off at Cheongnyangni.

1135
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:17,320
who are you?

1136
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,020
Who are you really?

1137
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,720
you...

1138
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:24,120
I am left-handed, but my right hand holds my heart.

1139
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:27,420
No. My right hand was holding his heart before.

1140
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,520
I have no hand in this now.

1141
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:33,160
I'll tell you again when I give it back to you later.

1142
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,060
Actor Sung Hoon, his luggage seems too heavy.

1143
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:37,060
Now is the time to let it go.

1144
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:39,760
I can't leave this wonder aside.

1145
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:40,660
I can not give up.

1146
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:42,060
Why do I separate waste?

1147
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:44,360
To protect the planet this man will live on.

1148
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:49,360
Yes, the time has come to truly protect the Earth.

1149
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:51,860
Fighting, let's do the best we can together.

1150
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:52,860
What are you doing these days?

1151
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:54,260
I'm selling something.

1152
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:55,760
one eye on you

1153
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,060
wait a minute here now

1154
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:58,560
So I have an eye

1155
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,460
I also have a heart

1156
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:05,060
It's almost like an encyclopedia.

1157
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:07,260
Please contact me again and I will return it to you.

1158
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:09,360
Oh? There are many bees around here.

1159
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:16,040
Ah, Seonghoon's voice is like honey.

1160
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,640
I will be punished.

1161
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:18,440
Oh? good night.

1162
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,230
Oh, it was good. I will be punished.

1163
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:24,330
I told him to get up if he thought Lee Joo-bin was pretty.

1164
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:27,530
The Earth arose and the order of the solar system changed.

1165
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:29,330
What makes you think like that?

1166
00:56:29,330 --> 00:56:31,030
It's a real setback, really.

1167
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:36,530
Oppa, don't take the subway or the bus, just have sex with me.

1168
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:38,430
You need to use public transportation a lot.

1169
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:40,230
Use public transportation.

1170
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,930
Sr. Kim Doo-hyeon, iré a Samhaengsi.

1171
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:43,730
Kim's performance is no joke.

1172
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:45,330
His face is no joke.

1173
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:46,930
Hyun really isn't a joke.

1174
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:48,730
You're not kidding.

1175
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:51,730
MBTI is COL?

1176
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:53,730
It's great. I love it.

1177
00:56:53,730 --> 00:56:56,130
No, I'm CUT OFF.

1178
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:02,280
If you expressed Kwak Dong-hyun in color, he would be black.

1179
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:05,950
Even if I close my eyes, I can see it.

1180
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:07,850
If I open my eyes, I won't be able to see.

1181
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:12,480
Ah, as I do this, it builds up.

1182
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:15,500
It is very difficult.

1183
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,100
Ah, this is very difficult.

1184
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:20,200
You are doing something very difficult right now.

1185
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,400
I'm going to sue actor Kwak Dong-hyun.

1186
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,700
For stealing my heart.

1187
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:26,700
We will respond through the company's legal team.

1188
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,200
Does Kim Soo-hyun's face feed you?

1189
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,300
Are you giving me food?

1190
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:31,300
No, I'll feed you.

1191
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,800
I guess my style is a little like that.

1192
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,300
First of all, thank you for loving the Queen of Tears.

1193
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:43,800
Thank you for your interest, questions and comments.

1194
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,300
Thank you so much.

1195
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:46,800
I'll give you the thumbs up.

1196
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:49,300
You are always evolving.

1197
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:52,300
It was fun to experience new drips.

1198
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:55,800
Please continue to love Kim Soo-hyun's drips so much.

1199
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,600
In the future, don't be lazy and continue to develop.

1200
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,100
I would appreciate it if you could always give me a little shock.

1201
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:01,900
thank you.

1202
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:05,600
Thank you very much for leaving so many comments and questions.

1203
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:06,900
I really think he's a genius.

1204
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,200
How do you think like that?

1205
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,400
It's so amazing.

1206
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,400
I think I need to learn.

1207
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,600
To the countless rappers who left comments.

1208
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:14,800
I'd like to thank you.

1209
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,600
I, who was still being handsome.

1210
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,300
It seems that the power of the NG has been increased.

1211
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:19,000
thank you

1212
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,600
Thanks to you I can go further in that direction.

1213
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,600
It seems that the level has increased.

1214
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,900
It's a little hard to breathe right now.

1215
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:28,900
It was a fun experience.

1216
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:30,600
Oh my god, am I there too?

1217
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:34,090
Oh? Actor Kim Jong-nam had glue on his face.

1218
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:35,190
beauty...

1219
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:51,540
We have finished our last shoot.

1220
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:55,160
thank you

1221
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:58,360
The long, long filming of King of Tears has finally come to an end.

1222
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,960
Although it was a fairly long shoot

1223
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,160
It was really fun.

1224
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,460
So I'm a little sad that this is ending now.

1225
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:07,960
In fact, when I first received the script, I was amazed.

1226
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:09,860
It seems like yesterday when I read it.

1227
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:13,160
I really didn't know I would receive so much love.

1228
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,560
So in better shape

1229
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,160
I will do my best to greet you.

1230
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,560
thank you

1231
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,960
fun and happy

1232
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,260
It was a rewarding role.

1233
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:23,760
Everyone, enjoy watching.

1234
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,360
I wish you much success.

1235
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:26,760
thank you

1236
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:30,160
Ah, makes me wonder how a year has passed.

1237
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,460
full and happy

1238
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:34,860
I think they were those kinds of moments.

1239
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:38,560
I hope you give us a lot of support and love until the end.

1240
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:41,960
The excitement and fun that drama brings.

1241
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:44,360
I hope you feel this as much as I do.

1242
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,260
I thought it would be good.

1243
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:48,560
Thanks for watching The King of Tears so far.

1244
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,060
thank you.

1245
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:54,260
The king of tears a moment ago.

1246
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:58,380
The last shoot was completed successfully.

1247
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:02,080
I feel strange again

1248
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:06,380
A luxurious feeling different from other products.

1249
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:07,880
I think it happened.

1250
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:13,350
Everyone, we are the king of tears.

1251
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:15,850
For giving me so much undeserved love

1252
01:00:15,850 --> 01:00:17,450
Thank you so much.

1253
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:20,650
Thank you for sending so much love to all our actors.

1254
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:22,050
Thank you so much.

1255
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:24,250
We gain strength from this support.

1256
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:26,650
I'll show you an even better performance.

1257
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:28,550
Everyone, thank you very much for this time.

1258
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:29,850
Thank you.

1259
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:36,190
Why the hell did you do that to Kwon Woo's father?

1260
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:36,690
because?

1261
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:38,990
Isn't the story much better?

1262
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:41,090
Follow your heart, not your head?

1263
01:00:41,090 --> 01:00:43,390
I would like to give you this advice.

1264
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:45,690
Don't be picky and eat well

1265
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:49,490
I hope Da-hye and Kwon-woo live happily ever after.

1266
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:50,790
arrest.

1267
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:52,290
Stop here.

1268
01:00:52,290 --> 01:00:54,790
You're hopeless anyway.

1269
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:57,190
I don't know what the timing is, but stop here.

1270
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:58,990
Hong Hye-in, hello.

1271
01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:00,790
When I saw the script for the first time

1272
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:04,190
I was a little afraid of you.

1273
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:06,890
I thought a lot about what to do.

1274
01:01:06,890 --> 01:01:08,490
It turns out that you

1275
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:11,490
It was like a cold, warm Americano.

1276
01:01:11,490 --> 01:01:14,090
Thanks to you I was really happy

1277
01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:18,390
Live happily ever after with Baek Hyun-woo.

1278
01:01:18,390 --> 01:01:20,990
Thank you.

1279
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:23,090
Hey, Hyunwoo.

1280
01:01:23,090 --> 01:01:27,390
Please live happily ever after with Hyein.

1281
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:29,690
I hope you lived well

1282
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:33,990
No matter what activities you do in the future,

1283
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:35,290
If you need something you have

1284
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:38,890
Sometimes I call you and use you

1285
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:41,290
I will do my best like this.

1286
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:43,890
Be happy. Thank you.

1287
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:34,720
Memories that I can't forget

1288
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:48,900
Face me with the aroma, I discovered it today

1289
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:58,820
I ask you how you are and without fail

1290
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:09,100
It flew and spread

1291
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:15,500
I've been waiting for a long time

1292
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:23,580
Will you listen again?

1293
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:29,680
The only miracle in my life.

1294
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:43,090
There are no moments that we share together

1295
01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:51,490
I came back after a year.

1296
01:03:51,490 --> 01:03:57,000
The days that I walked

1297
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:11,700
Every step, that moment never happened

1298
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:17,400
I've been waiting for a long time

1299
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:26,210
Will you listen again?

1300
01:04:26,210 --> 01:04:32,810
The only miracle in my life.

1301
01:04:32,810 --> 01:04:40,540
These were the moments we shared together.

1302
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:54,080
I find you again at the tip of my ear

1303
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:58,680
Hold both hands tightly

1304
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:08,700
Where I want to go, to our house

1305
01:06:58,680 --> 01:08:08,700
