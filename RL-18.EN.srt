2
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,100
What happens if I stop talking Grace?

3
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,100
That's my way of paying the bill.

4
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,100
Hi, I'm Grace.

5
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,100
What did I come to fix?

6
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,100
For the viewers who loved our drama.

7
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,100
We have prepared an incredible ending.

8
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,100
Even if I eat my lungs, it will be of no use.

9
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,100
This time, I saw our CEO Hong and became a complete fan.

10
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,100
Everyone just gathered together.

11
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,450
I'm sorry

12
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,450
do not do this to me

13
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,540
I'm very sad

14
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,540
This was confirmed by numerous display checks.

15
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,540
queen of tears

16
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,280
I'm going crazy

17
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,900
no

18
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,900
Hoar

19
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,900
Don't say my name Baek Hyun-woo

20
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,900
Before I know it, I see you

21
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,900
Even if I am reborn a hundred times, everything is a hundred times

22
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,900
I want to meet you

23
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,900
That woman must have been incredibly pretty.

24
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,900
no what

25
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,900
I'm not saying it sucks.

26
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,900
He just spilled something at that moment.

27
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,900
It was limping

28
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,900
I'm going to Seoul, call me a taxi.

29
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,900
I'm not saying Sunwoo wants a divorce.

30
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,950
Diamante

31
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:28,950
Yeah

32
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,950
This is the face of someone who loves the Queen of Tears

33
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,500
The entire world is stunned right now.

34
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,500
Regardless of generation or nationality

35
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,500
The countless spectators who loved the Queen of Tears

36
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,500
Another main character who completed the drama.

37
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,830
queen of tears

38
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,640
Last March 2023

39
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,640
The Queen of Tears actors gathered in one place

40
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,640
Oh God, even if I'm like this

41
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,640
Indie veteran who has appeared in dozens of works.

42
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,640
Oh God, I was so nervous that day.

43
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,640
How come everyone seems so nervous?

44
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,640
And finally, the day of the first shoot.

45
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:10,340
Opening the first shovel to mark the beginning of the Queen of Tears

46
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:14,340
My heart was pounding, half out of anticipation and half out of worry.

47
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,340
After almost a year of intense concentration,

48
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,340
I will definitely show you a fun performance.

49
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,340
Look forward to it.

50
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,340
We ask for your interest and affection.

51
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,340
We will continue filming diligently.

52
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,340
I would appreciate it if you would look forward to the Queen of Tears.

53
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,340
With the unison of many actors.

54
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,340
390 days of a lot of sweat

55
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:06,610
I know that's all

56
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:09,610
What Sochan ordered was a delight to the eyes with its beautiful images.

57
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,610
It was also filmed on location in Germany.

58
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,170
What's that?

59
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,170
Virtual studio?

60
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:42,170
They even did special filming there.

61
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:45,170
How is? It's pretty cool.

62
00:06:45,170 --> 00:07:34,280
hear your voice

63
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,510
going further

64
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:45,340
Many people full of thoughts about the neighborhood.

65
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,340
My goodness, how well I took this photo.

66
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,340
Even while watching the broadcast.

67
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,340
I didn't notice anything.

68
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,340
The smiles in your eyes

69
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:06,100
More than the stories in this novel.

70
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,100
You excite me

71
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:20,490
I think I can get to know you

72
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:24,490
my heart doesn't stop

73
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:30,490
I'm running like I'm dying

74
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,420
You excite me

75
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,340
Maybe it's because I worked so hard at it.

76
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,340
After the broadcast of Queen of Tears

77
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,340
The response was simply incredible.

78
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,610
Do you see the Queen of Tears? Please tell me.

79
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,610
Me?

80
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:12,610
Hyein-ah

81
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:15,610
I'm seeing it now

82
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:18,610
I haven't seen it all yet. She recently finished. She finished.

83
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:21,610
But I'm watching episode 14.

84
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,610
you also explained it to me

85
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:24,610
What's that?

86
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,610
Because, why?

87
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,610
I heard there was something similar to child XX.

88
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,610
What did you say?

89
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,610
Sensible

90
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,610
They are a department store without Herkina.

91
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,610
It's just a pretty big restaurant.

92
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:37,610
We also have room for Herkina.

93
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,610
No, I don't watch dramas at all.

94
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,610
Keep asking what should I do in Herkina?

95
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:42,610
That's what you were looking for

96
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:43,610
I need to talk now

97
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,610
I watched a drama called Queen of Tears.

98
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,610
I'm seeing it a lot right now.

99
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:52,610
Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow are the last episodes.

100
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,610
I'm actually really nervous right now.

101
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,610
Hye-in Hong Hye-in

102
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,610
Oh, I do this all the time.

103
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,610
I also cry and laugh

104
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,610
I was very angry

105
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,610
I had a lot of fun watching it because it was very immersive.

106
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:08,610
Now, starting this week, what pleasure will I have?

107
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,610
What else should I experience while I wait?

108
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,430
Oh, and our Hyuntae and Mi-seon too.

109
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:38,430
I heard you wrote something about the Queen of Tears?

110
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:43,430
Would you like to go meet him sometime?

111
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,530
you hit first

112
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,530
Then what should I do?

113
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,530
Do you know what kind of shoes my shoes are?

114
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,890
It's broken, right?

115
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,890
Is boxing good too? Cool, right?

116
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:14,890
Coach, are you tired?

117
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:20,320
Oh this is good

118
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,320
I think it was lightly scratched by a tree.

119
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,910
Hello viewers

120
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,910
I'm from tvN's Queen of Tears

121
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,910
This is Jang Yoon-ju, who plays the role of Baek Mi-seon.

122
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,910
Hello, I played the role of Baek Hyun-tae.

123
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,910
My name is Dohyun Kim. Nice to meet you.

124
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,180
since we filmed

125
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,180
I think it's been over a year since we met.

126
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,180
it's been more than a year

127
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,180
Our Queens family, our Yongduri family, our Hyunwoo Hyein.

128
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,180
I really, really want to see you.

129
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,180
It's a shame we're about to part.

130
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:09,180
But while we talk like this, I miss everyone.

131
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:42,010
When the people who ate at my house turn their backs and leave

132
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,010
You can't send it in a nice way.

133
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:46,010
At least I can walk away safely.

134
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:48,010
If you don't, there won't be any problem.

135
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:53,470
A boy who turns his back on me

136
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,470
I'm not waving my hand

137
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,270
It's like sheathing a knife.

138
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,270
it's so scary

139
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,260
Are you OK?

140
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,260
Let's have another drink.

141
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,260
What else should I do? You should come in. You should go home.

142
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:29,260
I think the old man adapted to Yongduri very quickly.

143
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,260
Have a drink with your father.

144
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,260
When we talk and talk, I

145
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,260
It was a little salty, but it put me at ease.

146
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:45,260
In fact, I called my best friend earlier.

147
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:48,260
This is the first time I've said this in my life.

148
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,260
I don't have any money in my pocket right now

149
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,260
Please send me 20 million, not much.

150
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,260
So what?

151
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,260
They said it didn't work. It was ridiculous.

152
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:03,260
If your best friend did that, you would be surprised.

153
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,260
No, not friends.

154
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,260
I don't even have 2,000 in my pocket

155
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,260
I feel so sorry for myself

156
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:15,260
But for the in-laws and adults to accept reality,

157
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,260
It seemed like it would take a long time.

158
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,260
there is nothing

159
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,260
I don't have two thousand in my pocket

160
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:27,260
Are you lying to comfort me, father-in-law?

161
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,260
There really isn't, I've never seen it before.

162
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,480
the topic is famous

163
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,480
Father, my father, really.

164
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,480
Baekdu Hall

165
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,480
honey seal

166
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,480
Why do you like this? Get out of the way

167
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,480
This building is a place where you can see your loyalty.

168
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,480
I'm going to use it as a medium, right?

169
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,480
It's not

170
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,790
huh?

171
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,790
I really want my rent paid.

172
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:58,790
So Bonghae?

173
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,790
I'm going to say

174
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,790
Anyway, isn't it our Dubong building?

175
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,790
What is Dubong Building?

176
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,790
The building of Dugwan Bonghae

177
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,790
Oh Lord

178
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:16,400
This is so cute when viewers see it.

179
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,400
So it is so

180
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:25,490
When I say one, two, three, river and river.

181
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,490
Now one two three

182
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:40,090
Do you think that makes sense now?

183
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:43,090
Yeah, I think you're scolding me for doing that again.

184
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:46,090
Because you are a bitch to the core who only thinks about yourself.

185
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,090
You don't care if the person next to you dies or not.

186
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,090
You're just looking for a way to live

187
00:15:51,090 --> 00:16:03,680
No, I mean it's a tumor.

188
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,680
So it seems like people always realize it only after it happens.

189
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,680
What Hyein said before

190
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,680
Did you know? Well?

191
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,680
Honey

192
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,680
If you knew, why didn't you tell me? Why did not you do it?

193
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,680
What have you been doing all this time?

194
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,680
But mom

195
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,680
I told you

196
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,680
Something big happened to me too.

197
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,680
Don't you ask what's going on?

198
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,710
You are so good that it doesn't matter if it's something big or small.

199
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,710
It's worth it.

200
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,710
Well

201
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,710
I'll take care of tomorrow

202
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,260
I will do it better

203
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:41,740
How much damage did I do to that person?

204
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,970
And how much I loved him

205
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:48,970
from now on

206
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,040
from now on

207
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,040
because you will have a lot of time

208
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,040
Little by little become kinder

209
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,040
Well

210
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,520
When you come back from surgery

211
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,520
we then

212
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,520
slowly

213
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,520
let's be kind

214
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:13,980
Get out of the way

215
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,980
Let's see, let's see

216
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:17,980
Get out of the way

217
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,980
Our second child has arrived

218
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,180
I was hungry

219
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,180
eat

220
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:48,030
Eat slow

221
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,030
delicious?

222
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,620
According to the police

223
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,620
They said they shot me with some kind of weapon.

224
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,580
Yeah

225
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,580
For me

226
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,810
Instead of me, Hyuna

227
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:10,810
they shot me

228
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:12,810
do not Cry

229
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,100
Our Hyunwoo

230
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:28,780
What aren't you going to do with your husband?

231
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,230
Don't cry, don't cry

232
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,230
brother in law

233
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,230
Oh!, why?

234
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,230
In fact

235
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:44,480
My sister told me to never say this.

236
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,480
that?

237
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,900
It's frustrating now

238
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,900
ah

239
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,230
It's really frustrating.

240
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,610
Oh, are you really crazy?

241
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,610
Why do you hit me?

242
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,790
Come out to my husband once again.

243
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,790
You're really falling behind

244
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,790
You do not answer?

245
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,790
Well

246
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,790
I knew

247
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,490
oh sister

248
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,340
What about the trilogy?

249
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,340
this crazy

250
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,340
I saw it, brother-in-law.

251
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,340
a bit

252
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,340
it's a little brave

253
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,340
It is not this one

254
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,340
I woke up as soon as I broke it.

255
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,340
Sicheol-ah

256
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,560
my sister has been

257
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,130
I was sorry

258
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:43,130
Ah, brother-in-law

259
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:45,130
I don't think my sister has come to her senses.

260
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,130
Go find the teacher and the adults.

261
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,480
but us two

262
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,480
Is this a happy ending?

263
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,480
Mi-seon and Hyun-tae

264
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,480
have a building

265
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,480
It feels like we're still at war

266
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,480
Not me

267
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,480
At last

268
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,480
Get a US ticket

269
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,480
let's go to america

270
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,480
So you gave me that building?

271
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,480
it's you

272
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,480
thank you

273
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,720
Even if I want to be with you, I will hold back.

274
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,720
I put up with it because I love you

275
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,720
Mom kept her promise.

276
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,720
You put up with it so well.

277
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,720
a young son

278
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,720
In that faraway country

279
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,720
meet someone

280
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,720
how to live

281
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,720
Without even asking me

282
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,720
He never contacted me

283
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,720
You held it up very well.

284
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,720
By the way

285
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,720
you

286
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,720
I sent my children to a strange land

287
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,720
I pretended not to know

288
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,720
I felt resentful

289
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,720
To the house where you were adopted

290
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,720
Adoptive parents

291
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,720
That's how I took the money and kept it.

292
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,720
you abused me

293
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,720
Do you think I didn't know?

294
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,720
Those people who didn't even drink

295
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,720
in a drunk driving accident

296
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,720
Was his death an accident?

297
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,750
What are you talking about now?

298
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,700
Do you think it was an accident?

299
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:42,380
I love my son

300
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,380
I didn't leave him alone

301
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,380
or bother you

302
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,380
or give you a hard time

303
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,380
People who block your way

304
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,380
I didn't just sit there and watch.

305
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,380
It's still the same now

306
00:21:51,380 --> 00:22:03,810
how that

307
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:04,810
me

308
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:05,900
here

309
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,900
Did you bring it with you?

310
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,900
I told you

311
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,900
I'll protect you

312
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,900
To do that

313
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,900
I do anything

314
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,900
Just to protect me

315
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,900
eh

316
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,900
I am you

317
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,240
Even if it kills me

318
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:55,300
The shares that Eunseong has accumulated so far are

319
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,300
How many percentages in total?

320
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,300
is 15.9%

321
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,300
I'm going straight to the inheritance.

322
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,300
Yeah?

323
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,580
I just checked

324
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,580
my son is dead

325
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,580
so it's all my son

326
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,580
my beggar

327
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,580
Yes I understand

328
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,790
Sr. Moseul-i

329
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,790
Former president Hong Man-dae

330
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,790
Video evidence of poisoning attempt revealed

331
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,790
It was shocking.

332
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,790
After the trial, Mr.

333
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,790
He was immediately arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.

334
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,790
Besides

335
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,790
Investment fraud and violation of foreign exchange laws

336
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:29,790
Alright

337
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:42,400
Sr. Hyuntae y Sr. Mi-seon

338
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,400
Well done to you both

339
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,400
Are you saying that dramas also follow their titles?

340
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,400
Worthy of its name

341
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,400
queen of tears

342
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,400
No, a record of tears.

343
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:55,690
in countless tears

344
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:57,690
The real has appeared

345
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:00,690
Also known as crybaby Baek Hyeon-woo.

346
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,690
You're crying?

347
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:14,130
I want to go home with you

348
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:15,130
I've thought about it

349
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,250
Hyunwoo's tears

350
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,250
The spectators cry too

351
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,250
I cried too

352
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,250
I'm sorry I didn't tell you first.

353
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,920
We still have the lock.

354
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,220
to know

355
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,220
The total number of times Hyunwoo cried was

356
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,220
number 40

357
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,220
When I think about it,

358
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,220
rejoice average

359
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,220
I cried in episode 2.5.

360
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,140
I cry every day

361
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,140
thank you

362
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,140
My son is having a hard time again.

363
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:26,620
because?

364
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,650
So beautiful

365
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:28,650
Use a special move

366
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:29,650
Red Sea

367
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:30,650
Make your heart beat

368
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:32,650
Yes, with that

369
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,650
I was just born that way

370
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:36,650
That I have to do?

371
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:38,650
you

372
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,650
To the true king of tears

373
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:41,650
to name

374
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:46,050
wait a second

375
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,910
because?

376
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:50,580
Are you cleaning it?

377
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,580
Do I need to let go?

378
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,580
I get angry when I see it.

379
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,900
do not Cry

380
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,900
there is no one like that

381
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:19,690
Are you OK?

382
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:21,690
Why are you crying?

383
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:22,690
I also want to live

384
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:23,690
very very

385
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,320
just by looking at it

386
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,320
Makes viewers' hearts melt

387
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,320
desperate scenes

388
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:54,950
I do not remember anything

389
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,950
Treat you like a stranger

390
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:59,950
What should I do if he misbehaves?

391
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:01,950
you're bad

392
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:02,950
One of the days?

393
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:06,430
because that doesn't matter

394
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,430
Just have the surgery and do it right.

395
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,430
Just come back safe and sound

396
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,100
please

397
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,160
and

398
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:50,660
Hyein-ah

399
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:02,390
do not do this to me

400
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,390
Don't make me want to continue living

401
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:19,260
I won't even recognize you

402
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:23,670
I will be a different person

403
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:25,670
you

404
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,740
You promised

405
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,380
Even if I have a lot of debt

406
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,880
Even if there's more to it than that

407
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,300
I will be on your side

408
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,300
therefore

409
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,300
Don't worry

410
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,300
please be here too

411
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,330
Leave

412
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:01,330
So don't pray

413
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,490
I'm afraid it will come true

414
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:09,900
I'm so anxious I'm going crazy

415
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,670
Hyein-ah

416
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,510
What are you doing? This is all.

417
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,610
Wake up

418
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:31,610
Did you have an accident?

419
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:32,610
somehow

420
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:36,610
That's how it is

421
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:37,830
is it crazy?

422
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,830
Break the glass with your bare hands.

423
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:40,830
What are these hands?

424
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:44,830
What is this

425
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,300
Hyein-ah

426
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,580
I thought I was going to die

427
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,450
Wait a minute here

428
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:27,450
A surprise gift for viewers

429
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:31,180
As if there were only two of us in the world

430
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,180
As if this time would last forever

431
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,180
Hyunwoo and Hyein, who only loved each other

432
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,470
Honeymoon trip to Germany

433
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:41,470
Maybe for two people

434
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:45,470
It must have been one of the best moments of your life.

435
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:51,080
Only available in the Queen of Tears Special

436
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,080
Honeymoon kiss scene revealed

437
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,080
really really

438
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,980
Hyein-ah

439
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,850
No

440
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:58,850
Don't feel pressured.

441
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:00,940
just me

442
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,190
It's because I like it

443
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:07,250
Just like when I came here before

444
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,250
I don't know the way

445
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:12,370
I will go

446
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:14,370
If you don't know the way, I can go.

447
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,230
Youngsong Kim

448
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,230
come slowly

449
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:26,270
Because I will follow you to the ends of the earth

450
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,270
Really

451
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:30,270
You can't understand people's speech.

452
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,820
The taxi arrived, I'm going

453
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,820
Go anywhere

454
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,820
Because I will follow you to the ends of the earth

455
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,820
Oh it really goes

456
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,490
Go anywhere

457
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,490
I will follow you to the ends of the earth.

458
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:50,490
Let's go somewhere

459
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:52,490
Because I will chase you to the ends of the earth

460
00:33:55,490 --> 00:34:02,700
Write it like the queen of tears.

461
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,700
I read it as love

462
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,700
It was told in our drama.

463
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,700
Sometimes it's sweet

464
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,700
Sometimes bloody moments

465
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,700
I just love you all the time

466
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,700
So people die

467
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:18,700
queen of tears

468
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,700
Those moments of love

469
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,700
let's grab it together

470
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:25,950
Two people whose images were narratives in themselves.

471
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:28,950
I feel happy just looking at it

472
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:32,300
It looks so good

473
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,300
How can you be so pretty?

474
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,300
Sra. Hong Hye-in

475
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,910
I feel like the entire universe these days.

476
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:41,910
Just the two of us

477
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,910
I think it helps.

478
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:45,910
So that's what I'm saying

479
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,100
the entire universe

480
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,380
for helping us

481
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,380
Do you want to get married?

482
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,480
Please save all my memories

483
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:59,750
because I won't do it

484
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,260
Just ask me to save you

485
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,960
you are a different person

486
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,950
when I am born again

487
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:25,940
That was the first time we met.

488
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,940
It's okay if someone comes.

489
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,940
so you can be yourself

490
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:35,450
I'll protect you

491
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:36,450
eh

492
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,450
Well

493
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:38,450
I will believe it

494
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:40,310
No, Hong Hye-in

495
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:43,850
why are you so angry

496
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:52,220
Did you feel uncomfortable because of me before?

497
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,220
Yeah

498
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,220
A lot.

499
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,220
I am not

500
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,220
He is so cute

501
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,220
Baek Hyun-woo gets very drunk when he drinks.

502
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,220
Makes people's hearts race

503
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,220
That's Baek Hyun-woo's special move.

504
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,220
So where are you going?

505
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,220
Use that special move

506
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,220
You should not do that.

507
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,220
eh

508
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,220
I won't use it

509
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:27,640
I did not do anything

510
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,640
Already trapped

511
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,210
No, when will I see this again?

512
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:35,210
holy box

513
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,210
box

514
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,980
I'm not an ordinary guy

515
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:45,980
Put a tag with a number on your uniform.

516
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:46,980
Make people cry like that?

517
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,680
Soy

518
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,680
Even if I am reborn a hundred times

519
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,680
100 times

520
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,680
I want to meet you

521
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,210
It's love at first sight

522
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:06,210
Is that so?

523
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:08,210
A Sucheol

524
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:10,210
Dahye was that kind of person.

525
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:12,210
Hour

526
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:14,210
My name is Cheon Da-hye.

527
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:16,210
¿Cheon Dahye?

528
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:17,210
but

529
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,210
in this love

530
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:20,210
There was a tragedy planned

531
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,210
then your wife

532
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,210
Cheon Da-hye, esa chica

533
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:24,210
It was a loss, right?

534
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,970
I am our dahye

535
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:29,970
Where am I going to look for it?

536
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:31,970
I didn't take everything with me.

537
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:33,970
I left something behind

538
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:34,970
That?

539
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:36,970
me

540
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:41,050
you left me here

541
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:45,260
Go anywhere

542
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,260
to the end of the earth

543
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,260
because I will follow you all

544
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,260
Really

545
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,260
You don't know how to hit someone.

546
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,260
Su-cheol is an idiot.

547
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,260
A fool who only knows Dahye.

548
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:04,700
first

549
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,700
There is nothing to fear in the world.

550
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,700
tiger in nature

551
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,700
sanskrit characters

552
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,890
She too

553
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:12,890
in front of love

554
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:13,890
He was a gentle sheep.

555
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:23,380
Oh my god, Hong Beomja!

556
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,670
You're crazy?

557
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,670
What are you doing now?

558
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,470
Where should I go?

559
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:30,470
Will the dragons ever return?

560
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:32,470
Wake up

561
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,470
Go home

562
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,760
You're crazy

563
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,760
I'm here now

564
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,760
Are you Kim Yu Shin?

565
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,760
auto tires

566
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,760
I still have to punk

567
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,760
Not coming?

568
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,970
I'll make you a cupcake.

569
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,510
also

570
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,510
Love is

571
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:52,510
beast too

572
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,510
It's a way to tame it.

573
00:38:54,510 --> 00:39:12,060
Do you want to see it?

574
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,660
That's why I

575
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,660
your beautiful daughter

576
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,660
You are going to hit me?

577
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:30,820
The negotiation is complete

578
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,820
Why do you want to see me?

579
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:33,820
Hey, who's the lawyer there?

580
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:35,820
you do not know

581
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,050
Dear Queen of Tears viewers:

582
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:10,050
I played the role of Vincenzo.

583
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:11,050
This is actor Song Joong-ki.

584
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,050
Nice to meet you

585
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,050
Because Vincenzo has the role

586
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,050
I came running

587
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:16,050
Actor Kim Jae-won

588
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:17,050
I'm working hard on filming.

589
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,050
Even if it's weak

590
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:19,050
I came to be your strength

591
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,050
prefer

592
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:23,050
I think I'm having more fun taking pictures.

593
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,050
well known to the public

594
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:28,050
Third generation ultra beautiful chaebol

595
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,050
As soon as I was born, I had a golden spoon.

596
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:30,050
A thriving department store

597
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:33,050
Anyway, it doesn't matter what I bring

598
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:34,050
because she is very young

599
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:46,230
A wide variety of genres.

600
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,230
I feel like it's mixed

601
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,230
I also had a lot of fun

602
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,230
Additionally, director Jang Young-ho

603
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,230
With director Kim Yohan

604
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,230
Have a lot of fun on the site

605
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,230
It feels like I'm gone

606
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,230
you are kneeling

607
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:04,490
evil seems evil

608
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:11,940
Do this to Jiwon again.

609
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,940
What I felt was incredible strength.

610
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,940
It feels like a time has passed again

611
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:16,940
I am also a spectator

612
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:17,940
as one person

613
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,940
queen of tears

614
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,940
Have fun watching it

615
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:21,940
I will encourage you again

616
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:22,940
This was Vicente.

617
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,940
it was vincenzo

618
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,940
Oh doctor

619
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,940
Do you provide robes?

620
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:28,940
Yeah

621
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:29,940
Later then

622
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:36,690
Look at this

623
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:37,690
I wrote divorce.

624
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,680
Uselessly

625
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,680
Hour

626
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,680
This is actor Oh Jong-seok.

627
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:51,220
I think you're under a lot of stress.

628
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,220
If you look at the person who took the sentence completion test,

629
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,220
What is business life like?

630
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,220
my boss is my wife

631
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,320
The boss above him

632
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,320
My father in law.

633
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,320
On top of that, the boss

634
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,320
Grandfather

635
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,320
My in-laws on my cell phone

636
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,320
As soon as your name appears

637
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,320
My heart races and my hands shake

638
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,040
Darling, I love you

639
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,040
I think I'm very happy

640
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,040
just thank you all

641
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,040
thank you

642
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,040
try it

643
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:21,900
It has been a long time

644
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,900
I tried to summarize it

645
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:23,900
still

646
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:25,900
still

647
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,900
do it well and have fun

648
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,900
It was a happy moment

649
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:29,900
queen of tears

650
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:30,900
Soo Ryun Kim

651
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,900
Go for it

652
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:32,900
mother

653
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:43,210
I'm here

654
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:44,210
Mami

655
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:45,210
What are you doing with your eyes?

656
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:46,210
Then try to place it carefully.

657
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:49,070
mother

658
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,070
AS is not possible

659
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,070
I'm sorry

660
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:53,070
I also tried to keep my promise.

661
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,070
now really

662
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:55,070
I think the time has come

663
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:56,070
mother

664
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,300
Hour

665
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,300
This is actor Kim Shin-rok.

666
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,300
Nice to meet you

667
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,300
actors that I really like

668
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,300
It is a drama that appears a lot.

669
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,300
Isn't this the most anticipated job?

670
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,300
because I can appear

671
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,300
I was so happy

672
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,300
I saw many happy faces again.

673
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,300
It was very good

674
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,300
Thank you

675
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:40,660
will make a special appearance

676
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:43,010
Actor Lim Cheol Soo

Nice to meet you

00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:45,010
I have a glorious heart

679
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:47,740
Will be fun?

680
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:48,740
Don't know

681
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:49,740
Will be fun

682
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:58,740
go now

683
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,740
Please get off work.

684
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,740
If you don't know me, you'll keep looking at us.

685
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,100
Where

686
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:16,590
We also tried our best

687
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:18,590
I'll have fun taking pictures.

688
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:19,590
Thank you

689
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:20,590
we wait for your love

690
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,750
It's Detective Hong Gil-dong's office.

691
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:25,750
Yes Yes

692
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:26,750
Gil-dong is also a member of our family.

693
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:27,750
I am also an elderly person

694
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:28,750
People keep telling me

695
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:29,750
new construction

696
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,750
I have a lot of talent. That's how it is.

697
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:33,750
Leave that building alone.

698
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:34,750
Sometimes I go out to play when I'm bored.

699
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:35,750
I bought it

700
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:36,750
Enough, you're a detective here too.

701
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,750
I have the habit of dressing up.

702
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:40,750
Nam Yohan, you too, come out

703
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:42,750
I have a habit of hiding.

704
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:45,750
in our office

705
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:46,750
They are friends like Woo Baekho, my brother-in-law.

706
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,750
Hello Hong Jin Kyung.

707
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:49,750
Nam Chang-hee

708
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:51,750
Greetings to Jo Se-ho.

709
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:52,750
Hour

710
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:56,490
you really are a star

711
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:57,490
after

712
00:44:57,490 --> 00:44:59,490
And train like this

713
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:00,490
many things came

714
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:01,490
It was a marathon at that time.

715
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:03,490
But now it's a detective room.

716
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:04,490
That's how it is

717
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:05,490
Thank you you like this

718
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:07,490
Because we can be together again

719
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:08,490
so happy again

720
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:09,490
memories

721
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:10,490
I think I can keep it

722
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:12,490
Go for it

723
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,440
beyond the screen

724
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,440
with countless spectators

725
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,440
Sharing Hiro's rock

726
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:32,620
We did it together

727
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:34,620
drama king of tears

728
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:36,810
therefore

729
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:37,810
Viewers like this

730
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:39,810
The charm that captivated me

731
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:41,810
What else could there have been?

732
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:46,570
these

733
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:48,570
There is something

734
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:52,330
of our drama

735
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:53,330
another boast

736
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:54,330
as soon as

737
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:56,330
It left a deep lingering impression.

738
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:58,330
There is an epilogue.

739
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:00,330
At the bottom of the roof of our company.

740
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:01,330
They say a basketball league is alive.

741
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:03,330
oh no way

742
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:05,330
Youngsook

743
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:07,330
get out if you can

744
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:09,330
Youngsook

745
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:11,330
Only me

746
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:12,330
Hyein next to me like this

747
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:13,330
I wanted to live

748
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:31,180
They say this is a lifesaver

749
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:33,180
Why am I so short?

750
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:34,180
Disappointed

751
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:37,660
that

752
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,660
Didn't you see the broadcast?

753
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:12,840
What did I just watch?

754
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,840
I thought it was a drama.

755
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:14,840
Not even my husband

756
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:15,840
Towards my ex-husband

757
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,840
What is desperate love?

758
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,840
This sincere confession of repentance

759
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:18,840
never seen

760
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,840
arrest

761
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,000
as you see

762
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
while you're lying down

763
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
you have become hot

764
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
It's hot

765
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
It is humiliating

766
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
because

767
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Change character now

768
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
They say you are very dramatic.

769
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
She was an ambitious girl in the first billion club.

770
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
It's ruined overnight

771
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
She was a provisional woman who went underground.

772
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Now I am a pure girl of this era.

773
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Wait a moment, President Hong Hye-in.

774
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
There are also malicious comments.

775
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
How long has it been since you got divorced?

776
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,000
this man and that man

777
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Didn't you do something?

778
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Ah, without even knowing anything

779
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
say it like this

780
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Even dying

781
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Isn't it all nonsense?

782
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,100
this is too hard

783
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:51,340
What is the ID of this guy?

784
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:52,340
Oye capture it

785
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:53,340
this is a pdf

786
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:54,340
Sue me immediately

787
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,340
For your information, there is no forbearance agreement.

788
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:56,340
What's wrong with your eyes?

789
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:57,340
scary

790
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:59,340
Don't let that go

791
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:03,420
Please clap and cheer.

792
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:05,420
secretly read someone's diary

793
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:06,420
spying

794
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:09,420
An epilogue that moved me.

795
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:15,420
indeed

796
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,420
Another legendary epilogue

797
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:18,420
It was there

798
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:19,420
Let's see it together

799
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,770
Tastes

800
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:26,770
I hate it

801
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:30,250
Tastes

802
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:34,970
No

803
00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:43,340
Tastes

804
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:46,340
I can't bear to say it directly.

805
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,340
your sincerity

806
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:50,340
Hyunwoo conveys his message in leaves.

807
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:52,690
I hate it

808
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:55,100
Tastes

809
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,460
I hate it

810
00:48:58,460 --> 00:48:59,870
¿oh?

811
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:06,580
Do you like it?

812
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:12,490
Oh really?

813
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:17,290
Cuteness limit exceeded

814
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:19,290
Daldal numerical limit exceeded

815
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,510
I am not

816
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:27,670
Soy

817
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:29,670
I love you

818
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:41,860
i love you hyein

819
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,860
Episode 10 was the epilogue.

820
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:55,950
Wait a minute, speed up

821
00:49:57,050 --> 00:49:58,050
Please slow down

822
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:38,900
It's okay to just watch it from afar

823
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,900
Even if I don't try to think about it, I think about it.

824
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:41,900
Just to see your face for no reason

825
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:42,900
The road just turned around

826
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:44,900
If this is your first time

827
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:46,900
That's just first love

828
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,900
The haughty girl from Queens

829
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:01,900
Hyein also had moments like this.

830
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,900
Actually, this image is of someone.

831
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:07,700
There's no way it's not first love.

832
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,700
At that moment, Mongolian Mongolian

833
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,700
It brought back memories of my first love.

834
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:14,700
It was the sixth epilogue.

835
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:17,700
Hello Hong Hye-in.

836
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:27,840
My name is Baek Hyun-woo

837
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,600
Soy

838
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:33,950
Hyun Woo Baek

839
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:36,580
because

840
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:37,580
Soy

841
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:39,940
is your husband

842
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,740
I remember everything

843
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:57,860
all I know

844
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:01,370
Let me tell you

845
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:03,370
If we don't face

846
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:06,370
Sincerity comes out like this.

847
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:07,370
I shouldn't cry

848
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,140
It is

849
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:13,140
you will see

850
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:16,230
This must be my first appearance.

851
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:22,920
it does not matter what happens

852
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:25,780
you

853
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:32,550
the promise you made with me

854
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:35,100
Even if I don't remember

855
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,220
Soy

856
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:41,020
be at your side

857
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,100
you can do it

858
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:46,100
us

859
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:48,260
Because it is the greatest destination of all time.

860
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:50,260
For Hyein who lost her memory

861
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:51,260
Written with tears

862
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:53,260
Hyunwoo's video message

863
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:54,260
amar

864
00:52:58,750 --> 00:52:59,750
i love you hyein

865
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:04,410
I loved you

866
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:09,190
I'll love you

867
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:13,220
Hyunwoo's affection index is the best.

868
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:16,220
Episode 13 was the epilogue.

869
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:21,570
There was a time in the past when I memorized your law book.

870
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:24,690
What was the secret?

871
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:25,690
Data Tips

872
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:27,690
Because I can't memorize everything

873
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:30,690
Only choose what is important

874
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:31,690
repeatedly

875
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:32,690
I was murmuring

876
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:33,690
But why

877
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:37,000
fair

878
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,180
because

879
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:44,890
Hyun Woo Baek

880
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:48,260
Hyun Woo Baek

881
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,260
you can forget it

882
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,260
It was Hyunwoo who left a video message, but

883
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:54,260
Hyein

884
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:56,260
It wasn't good at all.

885
00:53:58,420 --> 00:53:59,900
Hyun Woo Baek

886
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:01,900
Don't forget this name

887
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:09,160
A moment that could be the end of life.

888
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,160
she used to say

889
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,160
Three letters

890
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,160
Hyun Woo Baek

891
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,160
name

892
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,160
there were three characters

893
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,960
Hyein's affection index is the best.

894
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,960
Episode 14 was the epilogue.

895
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:45,820
I'm so excited

896
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:46,820
laughing

897
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:47,820
crying

898
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:49,820
Just because I have this time

899
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:50,820
I was so happy

900
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:51,820
queen of tears

901
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:52,820
of my life

902
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:54,820
last romantic song

903
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:55,820
I love you

904
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:57,240
queen of tears

905
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,240
For coming to this world

906
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,240
thank you so much

907
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,240
for making my life happy

908
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,240
thank you

909
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:06,240
for two months

910
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,240
I'm really happy

911
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,240
I think it helped me survive.

912
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,240
queen of tears

913
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,240
I love you

914
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,240
really happy

915
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,240
I think I was able to pass the time.

916
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,240
Team Queen of Tears

917
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,240
you worked so hard

918
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,240
I enjoyed the drama

919
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,240
Next time again

920
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,240
Please take care of me

921
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,240
thank you

922
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:56,180
dime

923
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:39,740
I can't even convey words

924
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:43,740
wandering through time

925
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:06,100
a misty night

926
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:09,100
you on the limit

927
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:14,540
Should I sing it and pay for it?

928
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:17,960
Beyond time

929
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,960
Remember the bright memories

930
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:28,040
We hold both hands tightly

931
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,040
Desire

932
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,040
I could have told you that

933
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:37,520
I was made to love you

934
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:41,520
To love you with all my heart

935
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,520
doubt alone

936
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,520
The words that I swallowed

937
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,520
amar

938
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:54,410
I still love you all the time

939
00:57:54,410 --> 00:57:58,410
Still in a corner of my heart

940
00:57:58,410 --> 00:58:02,410
Fill it with longing

941
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:05,410
wait for you

942
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:08,410
I need you all the time

943
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:11,410
run towards me like crazy

944
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:21,060
I love you

945
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:27,000
To know that you are a reason

946
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
I'm still breathing

947
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:38,430
loved

948
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:41,660
my sincerity

949
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:45,660
All the memories of being loved.

950
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:58,660
